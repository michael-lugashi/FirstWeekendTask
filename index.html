        A programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output. 
        Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most programming languages consist of instructions for computers. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific 
        instructions, rather than general programming languages. Since the early 1800s, programs have been used to direct the behavior 
        of machines such as Jacquard looms, music boxes and player pianos. The programs for these machines (such as a player piano's 
        scrolls) did not produce different behavior in response to different inputs or conditions.

    <p>
        The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
         It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
         HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be 
        embedded into the rendered page.HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such 
        as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
        Tags such as <code>&lt;img /&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as 
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not 
        display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </p>

    &lt;H1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/H1&gt;

    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. 
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. 
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification 
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate 
        .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to 
        improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, 
        such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for 
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
    </p>
    <div>
        <code class="code">
        <pre>
    Example:

    p {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: green;
    text-decoration: underline;
    }</pre>
        </code>

<section class="main-section" id="JavaScript">
    <header>JavaScript</header>
    <p>
        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, 
        often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and 
        first-class functions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,
        often incorporating third-party libraries. Most web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces 
        (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
    </p>
    <div>
        <code class="code">
        <pre>
    Example:

    let num = 5;
    for (let i = 0; i &lt num; i++) {
        console.log(i);
        console.log(num);
    }</pre>

    <p>
        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
        It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java 
        code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that 
        can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has 
        fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) 
        that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in 
        use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component 
        of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released 
        by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java 
        technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK 
        JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

            System.out.println("Hello, World!");

        Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant 
        indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale 
        projects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented 
        and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
    </p>
    <p>
        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. 
        Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage collection system using reference counting. Python 
        3.0 was released in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 
        in 2020.
